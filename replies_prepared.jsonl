{"prompt":"AI still requires understanding what you are putting in and the results given back. It’s only going to 10x any developer using it properly","completion":" 1x eng will become 10x engs ;D"}
{"prompt":"The biggest machine learning Python libraries are already connected into LangChain... so its like you said, impossible to say how exactly it will change... but it will change a lot in the next 3-5 years.","completion":" ya, the only thing constant is change as they say"}
{"prompt":"Without purchase parity deals, it's so expensive to buy courses. Even $50 packages take some thought.","completion":" there is parity pricing!"}
{"prompt":"So excited to get started! Is the release tomorrow, or how will I know when it's ready to consume?","completion":" tomorrow! will send email!"}
{"prompt":"Just what does 'fundamentals' mean? :) Low-level functioning of computers? Theoretical basis of AI? The takeaway I like the most on 'AI will replace humans' is: > AI will not replace humans. AI will replace humans who do not use AI with humans who do. Exciting time for builders","completion":" Data structure & algos, debugging skills, systems architecture, problem solve etc"}
{"prompt":"You have a great point when you say that it's impossible to predict what can be automated by AI. An obvious fact that we often forget amidst this craziness. P:Easier to predict what will NOT change.","completion":" only the best"}
{"prompt":"Pizza and eggs high protein let’s go. What’s your ig I’ll follow","completion":" high protein and carbs ;)"}
{"prompt":"An MVP breakfast","completion":" only the best"}
{"prompt":"Making space for free time allows for moments of spontaneity, thus increasing creativity.","completion":" yup, i've found i have the best ideas when im bored"}
{"prompt":"See you’ve been watching some sam ovens videos","completion":" binged watch all LOL"}
{"prompt":"Blade Runner 2049 vibes","completion":" i see it"}
{"prompt":"Is this for real?","completion":" ya, bad fires in canada, the entire city is yellow"}
{"prompt":"Where can I find the link to join the Discord/Slack?","completion":" it should under the first video!"}
{"prompt":"In ReAct based agents even if the input context fits, intermediate steps may throw max size limit. Any suggestions on that or alternative?","completion":" can you add extra prompting to make the outputs smaller?"}
{"prompt":"i asked chatgpt to give me some references and it hallucinated them ! got 404 on all of them. I shouldn't be surprised but i was surprised Tr","completion":" Try again"}
{"prompt":"Great explanations, thanks!","completion":" glad it helped! :)"}
{"prompt":"Very useful summary, thanks!","completion":" cognitive psychology this week."}
{"prompt":"What’s the first subject you are planning to learn?","completion":" this is rlly smart, hire people off upwork like college students. i'm gonna do this"}
{"prompt":"I used to do this, before chatGPT I would use tutors. You can find some great tutors for like $10 (for example ppl with actual law degrees)","completion":" liking the work tbh otherwise prob would have burnt out, making sure i take mini breaks through the day too"}
{"prompt":"How do you manage 15hrs a day ?","completion":" thank you good sir!"}
{"prompt":"Enjoy your rest days!","completion":" Awesome to hear!"}
{"prompt":"Another great thread, simple understand! Well written","completion":" yeah gotta squint a lil"}
{"prompt":"the font is surprisingly clear guys","completion":" most of the AI apps can be switched out pretty quick, don't think switching cost will be a factor."}
{"prompt":"I think switch cost + network effects will play a big role. Thoughts?","completion":" 90% distribution, 10% product :D"}
{"prompt":"I think that not only finding the right idea is the challenge but rather that distribution will be even more the indicator for success.","completion":" had to use it"}
{"prompt":"Where is the sock ?","completion":" yes #3 is highly underrated but the most important part for delivering the product"}
{"prompt":"Cool - the future is here","completion":" very true"}
{"prompt":"This web-scraping can be blocked by the browser any time correct?","completion":" its pretty"}
{"prompt":"Great explanation, but still not clear for me if an LLM (eg. gpt-4) gets chat history, user input (both text) and relevant docs ( some similar embed vectors created with an ada model and stored in a vector store), how does it convert embed vectors back and uses it in the context?","completion":" nah proxies and user agents is ezpz pass"}
{"prompt":"Gold. I am doing something similar in PHP land. One question: Chat History + User Input can easily exceed the token limitation of the LLM(OpenAI API). How do you dynamically solve that?","completion":" will write a thread about this."}
{"prompt":"Congrats Peter! Love the visualization with the stadiums","completion":" think you need to pre-process the data and summarize it"}
{"prompt":"I guess getting from 0 to 1000 is the first major huddle","completion":" thank you good sir! :) it's crazy how many ppl 10k are!"}
{"prompt":"Bro, what kind of templates are you using while explaining the code examples. like you're showing the code but the background is sky blue. what are you using? btw loved this thread. <3","completion":" ya its hard af"}
{"prompt":"Beast of an informational thread. Great job!","completion":" Appreciate it sir!"}
{"prompt":"Is this a new fad to stay concentrated and get shit done or something like that ?","completion":" Thank you sir!"}
{"prompt":"Lot of room to do situps in that room. Good job","completion":" yes"}
{"prompt":"You releasing a course = Instant Purchase","completion":" the door is long enough to do pull ups too!"}
{"prompt":"I can guarantee from your Twitter presence you do but I would also caution you a one time sale is great but you need to focus on MRR","completion":" i dont think subscription would do as well but I may be wrong!"}
{"prompt":"Great visuals!","completion":" Thank you sir"}
{"prompt":"Enjoy!!","completion":" Yummyyy! :D"}
{"prompt":"How does it work with multiple users?","completion":" what would be the use-case?"}
{"prompt":"Wow!, let's give it a try!","completion":" lmk how it goes!"}
{"prompt":"cool man","completion":" Thank you good sir!"}
{"prompt":"Wow!, I'll try it. By the way how much money have you made by selling your course. Love it. Its amazing.","completion":" Enough to pay for my daily McDonald runs"}
{"prompt":"Super congrats Peter","completion":" Thank you Jay!!"}
{"prompt":"this app has so much potential good luck","completion":" glad you see the potential good sir!"}
{"prompt":"Bought","completion":" appreciate it! Dm if you have anything in particular you want included in the course."}
{"prompt":"Hi\n@pwang_szn\n, do you have a Sales letter webpage to ee a bit more about the program?. Thanks","completion":" writing one up today, will send it to ya later"}
{"prompt":"I’ve just paid half of the mic’s cost","completion":" thank you good sir"}
